## Proposal
There is much medical research claimed that diabetes and hypertension are associate with each other. Besides, some of the studies said that diabetes is the main factor for developing hypertension. This claim is reasonable due to the human body's metabolism. Hence, the author's research question is, "Does diabetes  affect the prevalence of hypertension?" Also, the author curious that there is any difference between (1) gender, (2) age group, and (3) obesity.
