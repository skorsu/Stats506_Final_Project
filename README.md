## Proposal
There is much medical research claimed that diabetes and hypertension are associate with each other. Besides, some of the studies said that diabetes is the main factor for developing hypertension. This claim is reasonable due to the human body's metabolism. Hence, the author's research question is, "Does diabetes affect the prevalence of hypertension?" The author is also curious that this claim still holds if other aspects, which are gender, age, and obesity, be in this analysis too?

## Repository
There are two repositories.  

- Code: This folder contains the code for the analysis.  
- Data: This folder contains the data used in the analysis.
