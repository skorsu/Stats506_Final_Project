# Stats506_Final_Project

This project will use the data provided by National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)

## Proposal
There is much medical research claimed that diabetes and hypertension are associate with each other. Besides, some of the studies said that diabetes is the main factor for developing hypertension. This claim is reasonable due to the human body's metabolism. Hence, the author's research question is, "Does diabetes  affect the prevalence of hypertension?" Also, the author curious that there is any difference between (1) gender, (2) age group, and (3) obesity. 

## Data
The data used in this analysis is provided by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The author decides to use the data between the year 2011 to 2018. Also, to be more precise about the result, this analysis will use only the respondent who is at least 18 years old since both hypertension and diabetes might not be detected precisely in kids.
