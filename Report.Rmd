## Introduction
Approximately 2-3 paragraphs explaining what your question is, why it is interesting, and ending with a high level description of the analysis you did (not the results).

There is much medical research claimed that diabetes and hypertension are associate with each other. Besides, some of the studies said that diabetes is the main factor for developing hypertension. This claim is reasonable due to the human body's metabolism. Hence, the author's research question is, "Does diabetes  affect the prevalence of hypertension?" Also, the author curious that there is any difference between (1) gender, (2) age group, and (3) obesity. 


## Data
This project will use the data provided by National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)

The data used in this analysis is provided by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The author decides to use the data between the year 2011 to 2018. Also, to be more precise about the result, this analysis will use only the respondent who is at least 18 years old since both hypertension and diabetes might not be detected precisely in kids.

## Method

Data / Methods: Describe your data source and the methods you used. There should be enough detail here that I could repeat your analysis. Focus on what you did, not how you did it. Include a sentence with a link to a GitHub repository containing your code.

## Result

## Conclusion

## Discussion

Results: What did you find? This should be the largest section and is where all of your tabular/graphical elements go.
Conclusion / Discussion: What do your results allow us to conclude about the question you posed? What are the strengths and limitations of your analysis?
