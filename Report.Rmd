## Introduction
Approximately 2-3 paragraphs explaining what your question is, why it is interesting, and ending with a high level description of the analysis you did (not the results).

## Data

## Method

Data / Methods: Describe your data source and the methods you used. There should be enough detail here that I could repeat your analysis. Focus on what you did, not how you did it. Include a sentence with a link to a GitHub repository containing your code.

## Result

## Conclusion

## Discussion

Results: What did you find? This should be the largest section and is where all of your tabular/graphical elements go.
Conclusion / Discussion: What do your results allow us to conclude about the question you posed? What are the strengths and limitations of your analysis?
